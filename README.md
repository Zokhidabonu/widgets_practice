The GreetingWidget is a StatelessWidget designed to display a greeting message. You can customize the greeting message by passing it as a parameter.
The CounterWidget is a StatefulWidget that displays a counter starting at 0. Pressing the "Increment" button increases the counter value.
A widget tree is created with a depth of at least 3 levels. It includes nested instances of both GreetingWidget and CounterWidget, showcasing the composition of widgets.
Widgets are styled with various properties, such as fontSize, fontWeight, margin, padding, and decoration. The styling enhances the visual appeal and structure of the widgets.
